# PAAC Demonstrative Graphics

## Overview

This repository provides a collection of interactive reference visualizations generated by the **Knowledge Discovery Support Platform (PAAC)** â€” a modular system under development that aims to accelerate inventive processes through the extraction, analysis, and visualization of technical-scientific knowledge. The visualizations were created using data science libraries such as Plotly, pandas, and NetworkX, and illustrate semantic patterns, term co-occurrence, and multivariate relationships identified in scientific abstracts.

These figures serve as demonstrative outputs of the platformâ€™s capabilities and are intended to support research communication, system evaluation, and strategic knowledge discovery.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To host and share interactive reference graphics produced by PAAC in order to:
- Demonstrate key functionalities of the platform;
- Visualize patterns in scientific literature data;
- Support analytical interpretation and hypothesis generation.

## ðŸ§  About PAAC

**PAAC (Knowledge Discovery Support Platform)** is a Python-based system designed to support researchers in analyzing scientific corpora. Its modular architecture includes:

- Text preprocessing and acronym expansion (spaCy);
- Term extraction and filtering (pandas, AWL stopwords);
- Semantic graph generation (NetworkX);
- Visualizations (Plotly, wordcloud, matplotlib);
- Graph vectorization and feature embedding (Torch Geometric);
- Dimensionality reduction (e.g., UMAP);
- Multivariate analysis tools such as co-occurrence matrices and parallel coordinates.

The platform processes scientific data (e.g., Scopus exports) and allows for the identification of influential terms, topic trends, and semantic structures â€” ultimately fostering hypothesis development and strategic exploration of scientific and technological domains.
